# MonoDevelop.AddinMaker

AddinMaker makes it easy to create and maintain Visual Studio for Mac and MonoDevelop extensions.

To get started with AddinMaker, please see [this guide](https://aka.ms/vs/mac/extend).

For more details, [check out the wiki](https://github.com/mhutch/MonoDevelop.AddinMaker/wiki).

## Features

* Full support for creating, building, running and debugging addins from within MD/XS.
* MSBuild-based build system is extensible and allows building from the commandline.
* Code completion for addin manifests, file templates and project templates.
* Automatically handles referencing core MD/XS assemblies and assemblies from referenced addins.
* The `AddinFile` build action takes care of the details of bundling files with the addin.
* Multi-targeting support allows building against any MD/XS instance.

## Installation

Most users should install this from the Extension Gallery. However, if you wish to contribute to the addin, you will need to build it from source. This may also be necessary if you wish to use it with a prerelease version of MonoDevelop.

Because loading AddinMaker requires itself to be installed, scripts are provided to build and install it from the commandline. Simply run `Install.bat` (Windows) or `make install` (Mac, Linux).

To build against a specific version, you can provide arguments, e.g.

    make install ARGS="/p:MDBinDir=../monodevelop/main/build/bin /p:MDProfileVersion=7.0"
